## then
I started my freelance work to collaborate on exciting projects.

- host in a co-working space in Freiburg
- building websites with WordPress
- hands-on with teams
- modern communications tools bevor covid made it to the new standard.

> Lesson learned: Don't work alone, just with an inspiring team.

## now: my sandbox

Now I use my freelance work to test new ideas.

- different clients and projects - e.g., WordPress, office 365
- build my own co-work space at home
- host this site on azure
