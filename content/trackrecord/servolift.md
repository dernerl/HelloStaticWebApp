going from "Turnschuh-IT" to Service IT with the goal getting a Value IT.

The challenge was here with a history grown AD and infrastructure, to time the projects.
With old GPOs and users from the past 10 years also the mindset of employees and colleagues was this old.

At first, the windows deployment must be automated. Empirum from Matrix42 was the perfect partner in this case. After 3 months in the employment the rollout began. The next 6 month our windows 10 deployment were reduced from 2 days to 1 hour.

Next steps were to automate the ad cleaning processes, to secure windows itself and the clients. Other Tools help us to secure the endpoints. 

Secure your users is a big point in overall view of security. A phishing campaign was held, and a concept was established.

With Microsoft Teams it was the beginning to the cloud shift. Automation should be lived from the beginning and mistakes from the “old world” will not be repeated.
Naming concepts and policies were the keys for these goals.

A self-service portal is the next step in our road to a Value-IT. Instead of tickets user should be able to book IT and later non-IT services.
