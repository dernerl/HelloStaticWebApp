This is where my training began. 
Classic doing as an admin with 150 DAUs (german for brain dead user). As the first trainee, my boss and me rocking the projects together. My first job (after cleaning the storage place) was a ticketing system to handle all user requests. New storage and secure the active directory were following projects.
